- 👋 Hi, I’m @Justinagualo
- 👀 I’m interested in spending time with my wife and daughter as much as I can. I love anything that deals with outdoors especially hiking. I'm a foodie and the chef in my house hold. I love playing games on PS4 CODBOIV. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Ubuntu, Linux, Pycharm and continuing self study on HTML, CSS++, Jira Service Management.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simple projects to get a porfolio together.
- 📫 How to reach me by contacting me here at GITHUB.
